This is a directory that code project for DAT505 module.
In the Session4(S4-01),I made all cubes rotate in different directions.
In the (S4-02),all cubes are different colors and rotate in different directions and different speeds.
In the (S4-03),I used 13*13*13 cubes to make up a bigger cube.It divides into four regions on average an each region has its own color.
